            <p class="lead">In lesson three, we learned about Version Control and why it is important. This is concept that I knew about, obviously saving my work and backing it up so that I was able to reference it later, but never was in the forefront of my mind that it was essential to have every single copy where I have made edits to any and all files. I now know that Version Control, a system that records changes so that I can recall specific versions at a later time, is important documentation tactic while in any workspace. Having these versions available to you benefits you as a programmer, graphic designer, anything because you are able to track your mistakes, go back and see what changes you made at an earlier time, or even share older versions without having to un-do any progress you have made.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control, simply put is revision control, or source control. A way to utilize Version Control is by using a version control system. This is a simple database that programmers developed in order to keep all changes to a file under revision control. There are an abundance of version control systems, or VCS out there. Being a novice programmer, I am using Cloud9 as my Version Control system, it is a very user friendly VCS that is in place for beginners, like myself, to pros to use! RCS, or Revision Control System, is a software implementation of Revision Control that automates storing versions of files. This software is currently applied on most local devices, but that is why it is useful to utilize a VCS application separately</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a version control system that software developers use, along with other a lot of other version control tasks that require content tracking. A key aspect of GIT is that every directory on any local device comes with a repository with complete history and the ability to track versions of any work you create while using it, all without having to be connected to a network or a centralized server. In simplest terms, GIT is a content tracker that is known for it’s strong support for non-linear development, compatibility with existing systems and protocols, and efficiently handling large projects.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Understanding the basics of GIT begins with understanding how it stores and thinks about information. How it stores data is very different from how any other Version Control Systems store data. Essentially, how it stores data is in a set of snapshots of your file at the moment you are committing it, in a miniature files system, as a “stream of snapshots”. More basics of GIT are that nearly every single operation is Local, meaning that general no information from your network is necessary. Also, that GIT has integrity; this means that everything in GIT is check-summed before it is stores, and then referred back to that checksum.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT commands are what make GIT work. These are the commands that you use on your local divece, in the local terminal. Some of the most common, and more basic commands are, telling GIT who you are; git config --global user.name and git config –global user.email, creating a new local repository; git init, adding files; git add <filename>, or git add *, committing; git commit –m “Commit message”, or git comit –a, and push; git push origin master. All of these commands are used as a client to server method, to be able to translate what you want your repository to do with your files, information, and data.</p>
